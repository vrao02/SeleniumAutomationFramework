Here's a message from our users...
When it comes to Git, Tower does all the heavy lifting for you... and our users appreciate it!

Ben Gotow
I use @gittower and it‚Äôs so nice - I think my 2 faves are: drag and drop commits to cherry pick between branches, and rapidly selecting lines within files to commit so I can break a single pile of changes into several well described commits fast!

To me having a GUI is much quicker, in @gittower you can use a 3 key shortcut instead of typing a full sentence or even drag and drop if you don‚Äôt know the command yet üôÇ, the diff is perfect and the image diff is üíñ. You should give it a try! And the undo option is also üòç

Being able to drag and drop commits in @gittower and that it does an interactive rebase in the background is absolutely FABULOUS! Not sure why people like to type weird commands in a terminal.

Just used @gittower's new Reflog feature to restore a commit I accidentally deleted. Having done this before using command line, using Tower has simplified the process ten fold - just drag and drop.

The ability to drag and drop commits in Tower (@gitTower) to re-order commits is so powerful ! I would like to see a guy with his Terminal doing that in less time than Tower üòâ haha

Shane Armitage
I don't typically drag and drop branches in @gittower but was pleasantly surprised to learn the alt key switches between MERGE and REBASE.

Shane Armitage

Peter Friese
I am a big fan of @gittower. I *love* how it allows you to use drag and drop to merge branches - so intuitive!

Peter Friese

Russell Norris
